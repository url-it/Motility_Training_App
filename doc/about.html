<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>

<p>
    Cell Motility referes to movement of cells in the environment either randomly or in biased 
    direction such as chemotaxis. There are numerous scenarios where cell motility plays an important roal in 
     systems biology context. 
    Examples of cell motility include but are not limited to motility of immune cells towards tumor cells,
    escaping of cancer cells from tumor to othe organs etc. </p>
    <p>This app demonstrates &quot;Motility&quot; concept as implemented in PhysiCell modeling framework. 
</p>


	
<h2><strong> Motility </strong> </h2>
<p>
To account for cell movement, PhysiCell includes a set of parametersthat govern speed and direction of cell motility.  The biased, randommotility of cells is determined by the following equation:
</p>
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?d_{mot}%20=%20\frac{bd_{bias}%20+%20(1%20-%20b)\xi}{\Vert%20{bd_{bias}%20+%20(1%20-%20b)\xi%20\Vert}}" border="0"/>
<p>
where <i>b</i> is the level of bias in movement (migration bias), &xi; is a 
random unit vector of length 1, and <i>d<sub>bias</sub></i> is the direction of the bias.
</p>

<h2><strong> Motility Parameters</strong></h2>
<h3> is_motile </h3>
<p>
&quot;is motile&quot; is a Boolean variable that controls whether or not cells movein the simulation.
</p>

<h3> Persistence Time </h3>
<p>
&quot;Persistence time&quot; is the amount of time in minutes that a cell moves inits current direction and speed before choosing a new motility vectorto follow.
</p>

<h3> Migration Speed </h3>
<p>
&quot;Migration speed&quot; is the speed at which the cells move in &mu;m/min.
</p>

<h3> Migration Bias </h3>
<p>
&quot;Migration bias&quot; impacts the direction that a cell moves.  It falls be-tween 0 and 1, where 0 represents Brownian movement, and 1 rep-resents movement in the direction defined by the migration bias di-rection variable.  The migration bias parameter determines to whatextent cells move purely in a given direction.

<h2><strong>GUI Overview</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Config Basics</b> tab: input parameters common to all models (e.g., domain grid, simulation time, choice/frequency of outputs)</li>
<li><b>Microenvironment</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp; microenvironment parameters that are model-specific</li>
<li><b>User Params</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user parameters that are model-specific</li>
<li><b>Out: Plots</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output display of the results</li>
</ul>
Clicking the 'Run' button will use the specified parameters and start a simulation. When clicked, it creates an "Output" widget
that can be clicked/expanded to reveal the progress (text) of the simulation. When the simulation generates output file(s),
they can be visualized in the appropriate output tabs. The "Max" count in each output tab will be dynamically updated 
as those output files are generated by the running simulation. When the "Run" button is clicked, it toggles to a "Cancel" button
that will terminate (not pause) the simulation.

<h2><a id="instructions" name="instructions">Basic instructions</a></h2>

<p>Modify the parameters in the &quot;Config Basics&quot; and &quot;User Params&quot; tabs. Click the &quot;Run&quot; button once you are ready.</p>

<p>To view the behavior of the cells , click the &quot;Cell Plots&quot; tab, and slide the bar to advance through simulation frames. 
Note that as the simulation runs, the &quot;Max&quot; field (maximum frame number) will increase, so you can view more simulation frames.</p>

<p>To view the changing substrate fields, click the &quot;Substrate Plots&quot; tab, choose a substrate from the drop-down menu, 
and slide through the saved times. Note that as the simulation runs, the &quot;max&quot; field (maximum frame number) will increase, 
so you can view more simulation frames.</p>

<p>Note that you can download full simulation data for further exploration in your tools of choice.</p>
